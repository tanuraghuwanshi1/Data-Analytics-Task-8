# Task 08: Improving House Price Predictions through Feature Engineering

## ðŸ“Œ Objective  
Apply effective feature engineering techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and transforming skewed data to improve the predictive performance of a machine learning model on a housing dataset.

## ðŸ“‚ Files in this Repository  
- `task_08_feature_engineering.py` â†’ Python script performing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training  
- `cleaned_engineered_data.csv` â†’ Dataset after feature engineering and cleaning  
- `House Prices â€“ Advanced RegressionÂ Dataset.ipynb` â†’ Python run  script  

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used  
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Dataset: House Prices â€“ Advanced Regression Dataset (Kaggle)

## ðŸ§© Key Steps Implemented  
1. Identification and handling of missing values  
2. Encoding categorical features using One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding  
3. Log transformation to reduce skewness in numerical data  
4. Feature importance analysis using Random Forest model  
5. Model training and evaluation for house price prediction  

## ðŸš€ How to Run  
1. Clone this repository and ensure `cleaned_engineered_data.csv` is in the working directory.  
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the feature engineering and prediction script:  
   ```bash
   python task_08_feature_engineering.py
   ```

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes  
- Strong understanding of data preprocessing and encoding techniques  
- Insights into transformations for skewed data distributions  
- Ability to determine relevant features for model improvement  
- Experience building a scalable data transformation pipeline
